        I'm glad to see you on my website!

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 sm:text-xl">
        My name is Oleksandr and I'm originally from Ukraine. I moved to Canada
        due to a war after studying CS in university back home for 2 years.
        Altough I had to leave, my interest in programming hasn't decreased. I
        decided to expand my skillset by working on new interesting projects,
        which you can see below.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 sm:text-xl">
        If some of them interest you and you feel like I might be a good fit fot
        your team, feel free to contact me via e-mail or LinkedIn!
